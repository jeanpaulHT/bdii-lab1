cd source
g++ --std=c++17 p1.cpp             # same for p2, p3 or p4
./a.out                # or a.exe for windows
```

### On Clion:

```
git clone https://github.com/jeanpaulHT/bdii-lab1.git
```
- Open the folder as a new project
- Open CMakeLists.txt
- Comment out the line which corresponds to the test you want to run
- Run the project

# Notes:

- The input files provided were not used for the tests. Instead, every test creates it's own data file for every testing session. Still, it could technically open them too.
- If you're using linux, there may be some problems because of OS inconsistencies. Last pushes should have fixed them though.
